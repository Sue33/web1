The classic bibimbap so many Koreans enjoy, and which is also most known in North America, is derived from this bibimbap. There are more than 30 toppings that can be used in Jeonju bibimbap. Ingredient choice varies depending on the season. But, there are 3 ingredients that are key which are soy bean sprouts, hwang-po-muk (yellow mung bean jelly) and yook-whey (Korean style beef tartare). Another unique thing about Jeonju bibimbap is the rice is made with beef bone broth.</h2>
