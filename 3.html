But the more I make bowl meals the more they resemble Bibimbap, the mother of all bowl meals. If you’ve never heard of Bibimbap, it’s a Korean dish that combines rice, seasoned vegetables, meat, egg, and a variety of other toppings. While my bibimbap may not be totally authentic, I thought it was high time I pay homage to the wonderful dish and make a “me” version using the types of ingredients I have on hand.</h2>
