I am not about to go all sentimental here, but Daegu is an excellent place.
I enjoyed my 4 days here more than my entire trip to Seoul 3 or so years ago.
I could really have spent more time here, in this 2nd tier city most people wont have heard of, still a lot of mountains and missing buddha statues.
Right now I would have to put it right up there with Taipei as cool places to visit. Food isnt as good as Taiwan, or at least, its less varied, but thats applicable to all of Korea.
Of course you can eat any fast food you want, theres a strong USA influence across Korea, although I really havent seen any evidence of actual white people anywhere. I saw one couple on the train who I assume carried on to Busan (my next stop) and I assume all the air force jets today had white people in them.
It looks like, much like my first visit, most people from foreign lands never leave Seoul. I will report on this again when I am there in 9 days time.</h2>
